# UserDefaults

An interface to the userâ€™s defaults database, where you store key-value pairs persistently across launches of your app.
Using UserDefaults stores the data into plist file that is stored into the particular device's data. Locating the Device unique ID (or sandbox) will access the plist that is storing the data. In this first build of the mentor app, I plan on storing the count of the mentor's array in here. There might be a better way, but this will do for now.
```swift
let defaults = UserDefaults()

defaults.set(anyDataType, forKey: "String")

```

The key-value pair is then stored in plist file. This solves the issue of terminating an application. Saving this data in the defaults type is meant for small data types. Like user settings being saved. Ex: On tidal, I have my cross-fade set to 3s. Everytime i terminate the app, it stays at 3s.
If the value for an default is a string, int, float then you can set and retrieve like so:
```swift
let defaults = UserDefaults.standard
//setting
defaults.set(3.14, forKey: "volume")
//retrieving
let pi = defaults.float(forKey: "volume")


defaults.set(Date(), forKey: "Date")
let today = defaults.object(forKey: "Date")


let array : [Int] = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
defaults.set(array, forKey: "array")
let arrayD = defaults.array(forKey: "array") as! [Int]
//Here we downcast the array as an integer to remove the default optional array when using this function
```

##### User Defaults is **Not** a database!
Storing large bits of data in UserDefaults will cost in speed and efficiency in your app.
